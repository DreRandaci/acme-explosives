While they may look different, the basic functionality of a semi-automatic espresso machine includes a boiler, a portafilter and a switch or lever to perform the extraction. Youâ€™ll still grind and tamp your espresso (or insert an espresso pod), start the extraction and then steam or froth your milk as necessary."
